# ds-learning-path

Welcome,

This is a personal project that I am starting, in it you can find a career plan and preparation for a Data Scientist with the demands of a FANG.

Also, the visual and functionality development I am doing in Nuxt.js, it is the first time that I use it, so feedback is accepted to improve the structure and management of the project.

If you want to communicate with me you can write to [@silvercorp](https://www.twitter.com/silvercorp) on Twitter.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
